  <h1>About Me</h1> <br>
  

  <p>Hello! I’m Dikshita, pursuing Computer Science Engineering with a passion for Cyber Security and Linux. <br></p>
   <p>I love exploring Kali Linux and building projects that challenge my skills.<br>
I actively participate in CTFs and practice on platforms like TryHackMe and PortSwigger.</p>
<p> 

</p>Beyond Tech, I love being creative — I enjoy web development, designing posters on Canva,<br>
Being creative is something I truly enjoy, and it inspires me in both my projects and personal growth.
